# "drop" type is used when we want to grab a familiar that drops items themselves rather than boosting the odds of the enemy dropping items.

# Below this lines drops are not needed more of for the run and are just grabbing for profit.
# Most are useful in limited amounts which we already grab via boolean autoChooseFamiliar(location place)
#
# density 1.875 size 4 spleen consumables. boolean autoChooseFamiliar(location place) will already grab the amount needed for spleen
# Here they are only used to grab extras.
